New files uploaded the past couple days.

For the FTM-400XDR channels match on both Bands, intentional since I just want to RX/TX two bands when needed. I added the NOAA channels, then added all the Repeaters within 50 miles from Devon, PA. Then added Repeaters from Moab, UT. Then Repeaters around Telluride, CO. Repeaters around Rubicon Trail, in CA. Then I added a handful of Simplex channels that I've been able to chat with people on around me. I was disappointed not to find Banks on this radio.

For the FT-5D, I basically matched the FTM-400XDR. I set up Banks for the local Simplex channels. Then banks for Repeaters in Moab, Telluride, and Rubicon. I wish the other radio offered Banks, such a smart feature.

I deleted the first set of files. I've come to terms with the fact that Future Me will laugh at Previous Me's files. :)
